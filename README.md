# Skills Demo Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project consist of 3 pages:

- Home
- Create Event
- Event Details

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Things I am proud to Display

- Systematic Coding structure
- Complete Responsive Design
- No custom CSS
- Effective code on every page in lesser lines

## Things I could do better if had more time

- Create Atomic structure for common components to use it on every page (Reduced code further)
- The Create event page can be working using localstorage and make it functional
